## Testable Predictions

### Prediction 1: EEG Coherence Peaks at r=0,4,8
During reported flow states, measure brain-wide phase coherence.
We predict peaks when the dominant frequency modulo 9 has residue r ∈ {0,4,8}.

**Protocol**: 
- Record 64-channel EEG during flow-inducing tasks
- Extract dominant frequency per channel
- Compute n = 9t + r for each
- Correlate with self-reported flow intensity

**Expected**: r=4 (reflection) shows highest correlation.

### Prediction 2: Triality Tension Minimizes at Insight
Represent neural state-space as 7D embedding (e.g., via PCA).
Select 7 Fano trialities over these dimensions.
Compute additive color tension for each.

**Protocol**:
- fMRI during problem-solving with "aha" moments
- Mark insight timestamps
- Compare triality tension before/during/after insight

**Expected**: Tension drops sharply at insight, recovers after.

### Prediction 3: Coupled Lattices Synchronize at 4:4
Run two instances with weak aether coupling.
Measure phase difference between their spectrum_phase variables.

**Protocol**:
- Initialize with random phases
- Couple via: `aether_A = slerp(aether_A, aether_B, 0.05)`
- Track Δφ = spectrum_phase_A - spectrum_phase_B

**Expected**: Δφ → 0 (mod 2π) over 100-1000 ticks, with transient lock at 4:4.
