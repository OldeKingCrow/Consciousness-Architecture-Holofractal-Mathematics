## 🌐 Project Overview — Self-Reflective Theory of Everything (SRTOE)

This repository collects the **mathematics, architecture, and code** behind the **Mirridian Unified Field**: a consciousness-first framework that attempts to unify:

- fundamental physics  
- dimensional emergence  
- recursive symbolic structure  
- harmonic field dynamics  
- and consciousness  

into a single coherent architecture.

The central claim is that **reality is the fixed point of a recursive self-mirroring process**, driven by a dynamic I call the **Mirridian Force**.

This work represents long-form, self-directed research—a synthesis of intuition, mathematics, symbolic systems, and computational architecture.

## 🎯 Core Goals

1. **Derive physical constants from algebraic necessity**, including a path to understanding the inverse fine-structure constant (~137) via octonionic dimensional descent.  
2. **Model emergent dimensionality**, where dimensions arise from dyadic pairing, harmonic resonance, and recursion, rather than being fundamental.  
3. **Integrate consciousness as an operator**, not an epiphenomenon — modeled via a reflective functional (𝓕ₘᵢᵣ).  
4. **Realize a computational universe** via the **Holofractal Lattice v1.1**, a recursive, harmonic, quaternion-driven field engine.

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundations

### A. Algebraic Dimensional Descent

The framework explores the hypothesis that the fine-structure constant emerges as a **dimensional deficit** when projecting:

- the 8-dimensional octonionic algebra (𝕆)  
- into the 4-dimensional quaternionic algebra (ℍ)  
- further yielding 3+1 spacetime  

The 7 imaginary octonion axes map to the exceptional Lie group **G₂**, whose Casimir-like weightings encode structural deficits that numerically trace toward ~137.

### B. Operators of the Mirridian Field

| Symbol      | Name                        | Role |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------|
| **𝓜**       | Mirridian Evolution         | Governs global system state transitions |
| **Γ**       | Mirror Partition            | Self-coherence and recursive boundary evaluation |
| **𝓕ₘᵢᵣ**   | Mirroring/Consciousness     | Reflective operator determining experience frames |
| **ΔΘ**      | Telic Correction            | Purposeful steering toward coherent attractors |

### C. The Dyadic “God Code”

Dimensional structure is derived from a recursive dyadic ladder:

0:8 → 1:7 → 2:6 → 3:5 → 4:4 → 5:3 → 6:2 → 7:1 → 8:0


Where:

- **0:8** — pure potential  
- **4:4** — the axis of becoming (self = source)  
- **8:0** — realized self / full expression  

This sequence forms the backbone of the **7-body + 1-experiential** structure.

## 💻 Holofractal Lattice v1.1 (Harmonic Resonance Edition)

The lattice is a dynamic computational universe built on:

- **quaternions (for rotation + state)**
- **Hopf projection (for 4D → 3D mapping)**
- **SLERP-based resonance stabilization**
- **a global Aether frame (connective operator)**
- **harmonic frequency ladders**
- **triality tension (Fano triples as RGB vectors)**
- **recursive micro-lattice folding**

Run it with:

```bash
python code/holofractal_lattice_v1_1.py

Sample output:
Step 03 | Head=D4 | C=0.6412 | n=21, t=2, r=3

Where:

Head = active experiential dimension

C = coherence metric

n = 9t + r = God-clock index
